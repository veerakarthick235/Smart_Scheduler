üß† AI-Powered Smart Timetable Scheduler
Introduction
The Smart Timetable Scheduler is a full-stack web application designed to solve the complex challenge of scheduling classes in higher education institutions. Traditional manual scheduling is prone to errors, resource conflicts, and inefficiencies. This project leverages a sophisticated genetic algorithm to automate and optimize the process, ensuring maximal resource utilization and minimizing conflicts.

Built with a modern, AI-themed interface, this application provides a complete solution from data entry to analytics and exporting, incorporating intelligent features to assist administrators in making informed decisions.

‚ú® Key Features
This project is packed with professional-grade features:

ü§ñ Intelligent Timetable Generation:

Core scheduling logic is powered by a Genetic Algorithm to find optimized solutions for complex constraints.

Generates multiple timetable options, ranked by a "fitness score" indicating the number of soft conflicts.

üíª Dynamic Data Management (CRUD):

A user-friendly "Manage Data" interface to dynamically add, view, and delete all necessary parameters:

Rooms & Classrooms

Batches / Programs

Subjects (including hours per week)

Faculty Members

Intuitive system for assigning subjects to the faculty who can teach them.

üîê Secure User Authentication:

A complete user registration and login system.

Passwords are fully secured using industry-standard hashing (werkzeug).

üìä Analytics Dashboard:

A dedicated analytics page to visualize key university metrics.

Interactive charts (powered by Chart.js) display data like faculty workload distribution.

üìÑ PDF & Excel Export:

Seamlessly export any generated timetable option to universally compatible formats (PDF or MS Excel) for printing and sharing.

üí° Live AI Conflict Suggestions:

An AI-powered suggestion engine that provides real-time feedback on the "Manage Data" page.

Warns users about potential issues like faculty overload or unassigned subjects before generation is attempted.

üé® Modern AI-Themed UI:

A sleek, dark-mode "AI College" theme with glowing interactive elements.

The entire application is fully responsive and designed for a professional user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend
Python 3

Flask: A micro web framework for the server and APIs.

Flask-SQLAlchemy: For database object-relational mapping (ORM).

Werkzeug: For secure password hashing.

Pandas & openpyxl: For structuring data and exporting to Excel.

WeasyPrint: For generating PDF documents from HTML.

Frontend
HTML5

CSS3 (with Bootstrap 5 for layout)

JavaScript (ES6+): For all frontend interactivity, API calls (fetch), and dynamic content rendering.

Chart.js: For creating beautiful, interactive charts on the analytics dashboard.

Database
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database perfect for this application.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

pip (Python package installer).

2. Installation & Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/smart-scheduler.git](https://github.com/your-username/smart-scheduler.git)
cd smart-scheduler

Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Database Initialization
Before running the app for the first time, you need to create the database and the default admin user.

Important: If you have an old scheduler.db file in the /instance folder, delete it.

Run the database setup script in your terminal:

python database_setup.py

This will create an instance/scheduler.db file and an admin user with the credentials:

Username: admin

Password: password123

4. Running the Application
Once the database is set up, you can start the Flask web server:

python app.py

The application will be running and accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

üìñ How to Use
Register or Login: Access the application and either create a new account or log in with the default admin credentials.

Add Data: Navigate to the "Manage Data" page. This is the most important step. You must add at least one entry for every category:

Rooms

Batches

Subjects

Faculty

Finally, use the "Assign Subjects to Faculty" form to link teachers to the subjects they can teach.

Generate Timetable: Go to the "Dashboard" and click the "Generate Timetable" button. The algorithm will run, and the terminal will show its progress.

View & Export: The generated timetable options will appear on the dashboard. You can view them and use the "PDF" or "Excel" buttons to export them.

Check Analytics: Navigate to the "Analytics" page to see visual charts of your data.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Predictive Workload Analysis: An AI feature to analyze generated timetables for faculty burnout or student overload.

Conversational AI Assistant: A chatbot to allow users to manage data using natural language commands.

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Allow manual, fine-grained adjustments to the generated timetables.
